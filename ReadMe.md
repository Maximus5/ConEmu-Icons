##Icon rebranding

[ConEmu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu) needs new [icon](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu-Icons). It must be memorable, associative, simple and ascribable to PC/IT.

Here are few variants. To check them just save ico file near to `ConEmu.exe` naming it `ConEmu.ico`.

Have ideas? Post them here!
